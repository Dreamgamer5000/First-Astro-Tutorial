# My Third Blog Post

I had a minor hickup with setting up SSH key and connection with github, but thats all resolved now. kinda enjoying building with Astro. And, the [Discord community](https://astro.build/chat) is really friendly and helpful!

also look at [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) insane website. really helpfull. 

also have a look at my friend _kaezrr_ building [starpsx](https://github.com/kaezrr/starpsx) - A WIP PlayStation 1 emulator written in Rust.
