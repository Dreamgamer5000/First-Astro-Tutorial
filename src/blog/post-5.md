This is my first time making an RSS feed, never would i have thought its that easy to implement. also having refactor everything in the codebase, just adding a new .md file does everything, from titling on its own to viewing in the posts, to also making the new tags available instantly. 

This actually is cool, cant wait to work on astro pure to make it a proper proper website.
